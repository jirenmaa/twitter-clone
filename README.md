## About The Project

This is an experimental project that I choose to learn more about frontend and backend development and how they interact.

## Built With

## Getting Started

### Running locally with docker üê≥

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jirenmaa/twitter-clone.git
```

running the docker compose

```sh
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

If you are not configuring email, you must run the django container to receive emails for your user registration.

```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm service-backend
```

### Running locally with git clone

Assume you have 'python', 'node', 'docker' (optional), and'redis' (for email queue) installed to run the project.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jirenmaa/twitter-clone.git
```

installing django & vue depedencies

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
$ cd website && yarn install
```

After installing both dependencies, you must configure the '.env' file in order to run the project. After you've set up '.env,' you can now start redis and celery.

```sh
NOTE: You must leave the redis server running by not close the terminal.

$ redis-server
```

```sh
$ celery -A celeryapp.tasks worker -l info
```

Before you can run Django, you must first create a database in Postgresql. Or you can do this by running the following command:

```sh
$ createdb -U postgres twitter-clone
```

running the rest of the project

```sh
$ yarn website
```

```sh
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
