## Getting Started

Assume you've installed `python`, `node`, `docker` (optional), `redis` (for email queue) to run the project.

### Running locally with docker üê≥

clone the git repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jirenmaa/twitter-clone.git
```

running the docker compose file

```sh
$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

if you are not setting up for email configuration, u have to run the django container to recive the email

```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm service-backend
```

### Running locally with git clone

clone the git repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jirenmaa/twitter-clone.git
```

installing django & vue depedencies

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
$ cd website && yarn install
```

after installing both depdencies, you have to setup `.env` file to running the project.

after you have setting up `.env`, you now can running redis and celery.

```sh
NOTE: you have to let the redis server keep running and not closing the console

$ redis-server
```

```sh
$ celery -A celeryapp.tasks worker -l info
```

before you can run the django, you have to create database first in postgresql.

```sh
$ createdb -U username -O password twitter-clone
```

or you can create manually in `psql` console.

running the rest of the project

```sh
$ yarn website
```

```sh
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
